## Watch out! ðŸ’£

Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game created by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/?ql=4) in the 1990s. It's very probable that
you have played it on your computer.

Let's imagine that it's 1990. You are working at Microsoft, and your manager asks you to create a game for the new version of Windows, and you need to deliver this new game by the end of the week.

Thankfuly you are a 100x software engineer, and you have excellent skills when it comes to object-oriented programming, so you come up with the beta version of Minesweeper in an hour! ðŸ¤¯

## Why should you build this game?

Building this simple game was so much fun for me, and It helped me to strengthen my algorithmic and OOP skills. That's why I believe that building this type of projects is cruicial to level up as a Software Engineer.
Also It will help you to get comfortable using React Native to build complex projects.

If you are not familiar with Minesweeper I encourage you to play a couple rounds [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=mineswiper&oq=mine&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j46i20i263i433i512j69i59j69i60l4.839j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) before you start coding.
